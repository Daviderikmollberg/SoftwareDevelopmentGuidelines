## License
All of the projects we work on need have licenses. A single LICENSE file, linked from the README, suffices. Adding a license header in every single file is optional.

If a project does not contain a license, the default copyright is in place which means that no-one is allowed to make derivative work with your code.

We want our code to be freely available for everyone so we prefer permissive licenses such as
- Apachce 2.0 (quite permissive)
- MIT License (very permissive)
- CC BY 4.0 (for resources)

For more help choosing a license, see [Choosing a license](https://choosealicense.com/). Keep in mind that if you are working through SÍM you have agreed to use open licenses such as these. Furthermore, according to RU contracts you are the copyright owner.

When a license has been chosen, simply copy the license text, fill in any additional information required (like copyright owner and year) and write it to a LICENCE file in the repository.

TODO: Read about the SÍM contracts and other contracts with regards to author and copyright owner.

Licence (Haukur)
All of the projects we work on need have licences. A single LICENCE file, linked from the README, suffices.
Adding a licence header in every single file is optional.
If a project does not contain a licence, the default copyright is in place which means that no-one is allowed to make derivative work with your code.
We want our code to be freely available for everyone so we prefer permissive licenses such as
Apachce 2.0 (quite permissive)
MIT License (very permissive)
For more help choosing a licence, see Choosing a licence.
When a license has been chosen, simply copy the licence text, fill in any additional information required(like Copyright owner) and write it to a LICENCE file in the repository.
TODO: Read about the S√çM contracts and other contracts with regards to author and copyright owner.

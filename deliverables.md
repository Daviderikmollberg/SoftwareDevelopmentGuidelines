# Deliverables
The [SÍM guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O_yhAnMVft6AJNoRjOFFRwnZKN8YmEE6GNM_8w1tq14/edit) define deliverable types:
- APP (stand-alone application)
- MOD (a module which can be embedded into other applications)
- ADD-ON (a plugin to a larger framework)
- WEB (website with UI and/or API)
- RES (language resource)

These types are quite abstract and LVL does not deliver all of them.
Due to this we further break down these deliverables to offer more concrete guidelines:
- UI (web or other) = WEB, APP(?) or ADD-ON
- Server (web) = WEB
- Library = MOD
- Model = APP or RES?
- Command line client = APP

[Give more examples, what is a plugin? how you can view a model]

Translating from the SÍM requirements to these deliverables will need to be discussed with a SÍM project manager to answer the question of "what do they expect?".
